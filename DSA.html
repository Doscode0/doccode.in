  <h4 id="p">1)DATA:</h4>
 


Data is a collection of row facts and information.

<h4 id="p">2)DATA STRUCTURE:</h4>
Organised collection of data in particular format called data structure.data structure is a technique or method of study how the data are interrelated to each other logically or mathematically.
<h4 id="p">3)PURPOSE OF DATA STRUCTURE:</h4>
The main aim of data structure is to increase the efficiency of program and decrease the storage requirement.
<h4 id="p"> 4)CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURE:</h4>
<pre>a)linear :         
    (i)graph                    
    (ii)linked list            
    (iii)stack
    (iv)queue

        OR

non linear :
     (i)array
     (ii)tree

b)homogenous :
     (i)array  

        OR

non homogenous
     (i)structure
     (ii)union

c)static :
(i)char a[10]

        OR

</pre>

<h4 id="p">5)WHAT IS ALGORITHIM ?</h4>

The step by step description of any program in general language is called algorithim.

<pre>         OR </pre>

 algorithim is a sequence of an clear instruction used to solving a problem .such a way that it can implimented as a program for computer.

 <h4 id="p" >6)CHARACTERISTICS OF ALGORITHIM</h4>
 <pre>
a)input-o or more well defined inputs
b)output-must generate atleast one output
c)umambigious/definiteness
d)finiteness
e)effectiveness
 </pre>
<h4 id="p">7)DATATYPE AND ITS TYPE:</h4>
datatype is a type of data which is used in the program.In other word we can say that it is used to declare a variable.
<pre>            OR </pre>
datatype specify how we entered data in our program and what type of data we entred.

<h5>ITS TYPE</h5>
<pre>
i)Primary datatype<br>
ii)Secondary datatype

primary datatype :-

                  SIZE
                --------
Int     -        2 bytes  
char    -        1 bytes
float   -        4 bytes
void    -        no size


secondary datatype :-

1)Array
2)Pointer
3)Structure
4)Union</pre>

<h4>8)ABSTRAC DATA TYPE:</h4>

Mathematically model of data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate these objects.
<br>

ex--lists,graph,array along with their objects(abstrac datatype)


<h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINEAR AND NONLINEAR</h4>

<h4>10)DATA STRUCTURE:</h4>

Data structure is of two types there are <br> i) Primitive( ex-int,float,char,double)<br>
<br>
ii) Non primitive
<br>
<br>
Non primitive data structure is of two types <br> 1)Linear <br>
ii)Non-linear
<br>
<br>
Linear d.s is of two types (i.e :- static,dynamic)<br<br>
Non-linear d.s is of two types (i.e :- tree,graph)
<h4>11)ALGORITHIM COMPLEXITY:-</h4>
Algorithim complexity refers to the analysis of an algorithim performance in term of time and space requirement as a function of input size.
<h4>12)SPACE COMPLEXITY:-</h4>
Total amount of memory required by an algorithim for its complete execution called space complexity
<h4>13) CONSTANT SPACE COMPLEXITY:-</h4>
If any algorithim requires fixed amount of space then the space complexity is called constant space complexity.
<pre>
  Ex - int sqrt(int n){
    return n*n;
    }
</pre>
<h4>14)LINEAR SPACE COMPLEXITY</h4>
If the amount of space required by algorithim is increase of input values then that space complexity is called linear space complexity.
<pre>
  EX-int sum(int arr[],int n){
    int sum=0;
    for(int sum i=0;i<=n;i++)
         {
            sum=sum+arr[i];
          }
    return sum;
    }
</pre>
<h4>15) TIME COMPLEXITY:-</h4>
Total amount of time required by an algorithim to its complete execution called time complexity.
<h4>16) CONSTANT SPACE COMPLEXITY</h4>
If any algorithim required fixed amount of space then the space complexity which said to be const space complexity.
<pre>
  Ex-
  int sqrt(int n)
    {
      return n*n;
     }
</pre>
<h4>17)LINEAR TIME COMPLEXITY:</h4>
If the amount of space required by algorithim is increase of input values then that space complexity is called linear space complexity.
<pre>
  int sum(int a[],int n)
  {
    int sum=0;
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
      {
        sum=sum+a[i];
       }
    return sum;
  }
</pre>
<h4>18)DATA SPACE:</h4>
It is the amount of memory use to store all the variable and constant.
<h4>19)ARRAY</h4>
a)Array is derived data type which is constured by the help of primitive  data type.
b)Array is a variable which store more than one values of same data types in a continuous memory location.
<h4>20)LINEAR ARRAY</h4>
-A linear array is a list of a finite number n of homogenous data elements(i.e:- data element of same time )such that -
  a)The elements of the array are referenced respetively by an index set consecutive numbers.
  b)The elements of the array are stored respetively in successive memory location.
<h4>21)DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPERATION IN ARRAY LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE</h4>
<pre>
  a)TRAVERSAL:- 
  I)Processing each element in list.
  II)search finding the location of element finding the location of element with a given value.

b)INSERTION:-
  -Adding new element of list

c)DELETION:-
  -Removing elements from list.

d)SORTING:-
  -Arranging the elements in sum type of order.

E)MERGING:-
  -Combining to list to be a single list.
</pre>
<h4>22)TRAVERSING IN A LINEAR ARRAY </h4>
<pre>
  i)[Initialige counter] set K=LB. 
  ii)Repeat steps 3 and 4 while K<UB.
  iii)[Visit elements apply process to linear array of [K]].
  iv)[Increase the counter]  set K <- K++
  v)[End of stop 2 loop].
  vi)Exist.
</pre>
<h4>23.INSERTION IN LINEAR ARRAYS</h4>
<pre>
  -Here LA is a linear array with  N elements and K is a positive intiger. such that K<N This algorithm inserts an element item into the Kth position in LA. 
 I)[Intialge counter] set J=N.
 II)Repeat step 3&4 while J>K.
 III)[Move jth element downward]
     Set LA[J+1]=LA[J]
 IV)[Decrease counter] Set J=J-1
    [End of step 2 loop]
 V)[Insert element set LA[K]= ITEM
 VI)[Rest N] Set N=NH
